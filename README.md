# What is this website doing?

LastSpotifyConverter will get your spotify authorization to read data (to get your userId) and add new playlist to your account. After that you will be redirected to
pass LastFm username (this does not has to be yours :3) and select timespan of track listening. After 20-30 sec a newly created playlist will appear on your spotify.
